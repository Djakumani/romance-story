          <p id="line1" class="commentable">The city skyline gleamed under the fading light, casting an amber glow across the towering high-rise where ENFJ stood, his gaze sweeping over the empire he’d built. Glass and steel reflected his achievements—a kingdom forged through ambition, connections, and sacrifice. He’d thought that standing here, overlooking it all, would fill him with satisfaction. And yet, as he leaned against the cold glass, a familiar emptiness settled over him.

            He had power, influence, everything he’d once promised her. But somehow, it still wasn’t enough.
            
            He exhaled, letting the silence of his penthouse office wash over him. Tonight was a celebration—a networking event to honor his recent project’s success, packed with influential figures eager to be seen by his side. The accolades were predictable by now, each one landing with less and less weight. But the promise of distraction, however hollow, was better than facing the unshakable feeling gnawing at him.
            
            The murmur of voices and soft clinking of glasses began to fill the room as his guests gathered below, awaiting his arrival. He allowed himself one last glance over the city before pulling himself away from the window, adjusting his suit jacket, and putting on the mask of effortless confidence he’d perfected over the years.
            
            Descending into the event hall, he navigated the crowd with a polite smile, exchanging greetings and nodding at the obligatory praises thrown his way. Everything was smooth, controlled—until a familiar figure caught his eye.
            
            He froze, his expression unreadable, but his pulse quickened beneath his composed exterior.
            
            It couldn’t be. She was here, of all places.
            
            INFP stood across the room, her gaze locked onto him with a quiet intensity that both startled and enthralled him. Her presence was the last thing he’d expected, a ghost from a past he’d long since buried—or tried to. She hadn’t changed much; her expression held the same quiet strength he remembered, yet there was something sharper, something more resolute in her posture. And beside her stood a man he recognized all too well.
            
            His rival. The same man who’d tried to undermine him more times than he could count, now standing by her side.
            
            The tightness in his chest deepened. A part of him wanted to believe she’d shown up by coincidence, but he knew better. She was here for a reason.
            
            As if sensing his thoughts, her gaze flickered over to her companion, a subtle but unmistakable display of unity. The corners of her mouth curved into the faintest hint of a smile—one that wasn’t meant for him. It was a silent statement, a challenge he hadn’t anticipated.
            
            ENFJ’s jaw tightened, his hand reflexively clenching around the glass he held. He forced himself to maintain his composure, to hold her gaze with the same calm he’d perfected. She’d made her move; now it was his turn.
            
            The crowd around him blurred as he walked toward her, each step steady and deliberate. He ignored the polite voices trying to catch his attention, his focus honed in on her and the unspoken tension that electrified the space between them. When he finally stood before her, he kept his voice controlled, masking the tumult of emotions roiling beneath the surface.
            
            “Didn’t expect to see you here.” His words were smooth, a practiced charm hiding the undercurrent of bitterness.
            
            Her eyes met his, unwavering. “I thought it was time we caught up,” she replied, her tone carrying a weight that belied the simplicity of her words.
            
            He glanced at the man beside her, his expression impassive but sharp. “I see you brought company.”
            
            She raised an eyebrow, a flicker of amusement dancing in her eyes. “I thought it would make things… interesting.”
            
            A small smile played at his lips, though there was nothing warm about it. “You always had a way with timing.”
            
            Her gaze flicked over him, assessing, as if weighing the empire he’d built against the man standing before her. She hadn’t come here to catch up. She’d come to remind him of the past, of promises he’d broken and bridges he’d burned. And she wasn’t alone.
            
            For the first time in years, he felt a pang of something uncomfortably close to regret. But he pushed it down, locking it behind the mask he’d worn for so long.
            
            “Well,” he said, his voice quiet but laced with an edge, “enjoy the view.”
            
            With a curt nod, he turned and disappeared into the crowd, leaving her standing there, her silent challenge hanging in the air. But as he moved away, he couldn’t shake the feeling that this wasn’t over—that the empire he’d built might not be enough to keep the past from catching up with him.
